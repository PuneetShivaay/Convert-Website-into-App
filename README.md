You can convert your website into app. You need to just simply download this code and update the url to your website url.
To update the URL navigate to lib>src>app.dart 
Change the url ('https://vragger.com') to Your website's URL & change the title ('Vragger') to Your App's title.

Website to Mobile App Converter: This project explores the capabilities of Flutter to transform web experiences into native-like mobile applications. I developed a user-friendly interface where users can input any website URL, and the application leverages Flutter's WebView widget to display the content within a mobile wrapper. This project allowed me to gain practical experience in cross-platform mobile development and understand the nuances of embedding web content in mobile apps.
